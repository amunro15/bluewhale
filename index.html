            Blue whales can reach up to 100 feet in length and 200 tons in weight. Their hearts can weigh as much as automobile and their tongues as much as an elephant.
          </p>
          <p>
            These gigantic creatures reach this incredible size by digesting as much as four tons of krill per day. Krill are trapped inside the mouth of the whale, and then excess water is filtered out through  baleen in their upper jaws.
          </p>
          <p>
            On this seemingly small intake of energy, Blue Whales can swim at up to 20 miles per hour.

            BREACH
          </h3>
          <p>
            Breaching occurs when blue whales lift at least 40% of their bodies out of the water.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is still unclear as to why whales breach. Some believe they are attempting to use the force of the water to rid their body of parasites, others think breaching is a form of communication.
          </p>
          <p>
            And of course, these whales could be breaching just because it's fun.

            Blue whales can live to 80 or 90 years, although one blue whale was recorded to have lived until 110 years old.
          </p>
          <p>
            The predators they face include sharks and killer whales, but the real threat they face is hunting by humans.

          Whales make noise in order to communicate with one another. Whales also communicate to locate food and locate other members of their "pod", or the group in which they travel.
        </p>
        <p>
          Blue whales make three types of noises: clicks, whistles, and pulsed calls. Clicks are used for navigational purposes, whereas whistles and pulsed calls are  used in social interactions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Different pods use different intonations and dialects in order to discriminate family from strangers.
